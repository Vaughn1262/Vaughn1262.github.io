# Weather-Program
## Overview
[Weather Web Application](https://vaughn1262.github.io/)

This is my attempt at learning Javascript along with CSS and HTML to make a basic web application. This web app will allow the user to enter a location and get the weather for that location at the moment. It also changes the weather icon based on the current weather at the user specified location.

I have a Javascript file called script.js that contains all the logic for the application. This is linked to the index.html file that sets up the format of the webpage. I also linked the style.css file to edit the fonts, positions, and other visual specifics of the webpage. The nice thing about doing this web application is along with learning javascript, I was able to see how it fit with the CSS and HTML languages to make useful web applications.

I wrote this software to have a useful web application for weather and to learn Javascript. I think I accomplished what I sought out to did more than I intitially thought. I can also add to this program and make it better easily.

## Development Environment

I used visual studio code as my editor and used github as my source control. I am also using Github pages to host the webpage for the application. I am using Github desktop to sync my changes with Github.

I used Javascript for all of my logic and used HTML for the webpage and CSS for the different fonts, backgrounds, and other visuals.

Copilot is really useful to learn how new languages work and why some code doesn't work. Very useful learning tool.
