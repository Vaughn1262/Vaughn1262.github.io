# Weather-Program
## Overview
[Weather Web Application](https://vaughn1262.github.io/)

This is my attempt at learning Javascript along with CSS and HTML to make a basic web application. This web app will allow the user to enter a location and get the weather for that location at the moment. It also changes the weather icon based on the current weather at the user specified location.

I have a Javascript file called script.js that contains all the logic for the application. This is linked to the index.html file that sets up the format of the webpage. I also linked the style.css file to edit the fonts, positions, and other visual specifics of the webpage. The nice thing about doing this web application is along with learning javascript, I was able to see how it fit with the CSS and HTML languages to make useful web applications.

I wrote this software to have a useful web application for weather and to learn Javascript. I think I accomplished what I sought out to did more than I intitially thought. I can also add to this program and make it better easily.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

## Development Environment

I used visual studio code as my editor and used github as my source control. I am also using Github pages to host the webpage for the application. I am using Github desktop to sync my changes with Github.

I used Javascript for all of my logic and used HTML for the webpage and CSS for the different fonts, backgrounds, and other visuals.
